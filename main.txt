Current Business Customer: You hereby request that Spectrum transfer your account, including any services, equipment, rights and information, to the
above named New Customer. You will make arrangements directly with the New Customer for the payment of any existing balance on your account.
You are responsible for the transfer of all Spectrum equipment to the New Customer. You acknowledge that the equipment and account records will
include information about you, your use of the service and historical information about your account. After the transfer, all information including your
phone records (i.e., phone numbers called/received and the time, location and duration of those calls), emails (i.e., emails sent/received) and television
viewing history (i.e., video on demand purchases) will be accessible to and controlled by the New Customer.


New Business Customer: You hereby agree to transfer the above named Spectrum account and assume all obligations, including any existing
equipment, packages and outstanding balances, into your name. You will become legally responsible for this account, paying any balance owed and
acknowledge that the account will be transferred with the existing pricing and package. You accept responsibility for the equipment currently assigned to
the account and understand that you must return all Spectrum equipment or pay the applicable unreturned equipment fee. If Spectrum Voice is provided,
you also acknowledge that our Spectrum Voice Service does not have its own power supply. If there is a power outage, or if there is a disruption to the
cable network, Spectrum Voice service will not work. In such cases it will not be possible to place or receive calls including calls to access emergency
911 services. In the event of power outages, the modem, including all phones and services connected to or powered by it, will not work. Power outages
will disrupt E911 service and the use of Spectrum Voice service as the connection between a security system and central monitoring services. To reduce
this risk, you may choose to purchase a battery backup for use in the event of a power outage that is not also a network-related outage. Each battery
backup is designed to provide power for up to 8 hours (or 5 hours of “talk” time) for a power outage at your location that is not also a network-related
outage. In the event the battery life is exhausted and your power is out you will not be able to use your service including 911. In the event of an outage of
Spectrum’s network, including a power outage affecting Spectrum’s network, you will not be able to make any calls, including 911 calls, even if your
battery is not exhausted. You accept responsibility for all previous owner’s phone records and emails. Welcome Kits can be found at
www.spectrumbusiness.net/support and Privacy Policies and Legal Notices can be found at www.spectrum.com/policies. You agree to be bound by the
applicable Terms and Conditions of Service, and agree that your continued use of Spectrum’s services shall constitute your acceptance of any future
changes.
